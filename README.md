Learning HTML & CSS on your own is somewhat of a pain in the ass, especially when you have ADD. Trying to teach yourself thoroughly and accurately tends to take up a lot more time than it normally would. Hell, by now I should be a seasoned professional looking at the number of years I have dedicated to this art. Which would be the art of Webdesign. However, after approximately 10 years of trying to further my knowledge in HTML & CSS, I decided I had grown bored and wasn't excited about knowledge, as I once was. So what's the next topic to dive into? JavaScript. I am adding JS to what I am already familiar with, which is definately the change I needed. I find that I am now sitting on the edge of my seat, lower-back pulsating with pain, all the while still drenched in Sublime Text 3. I am adding, deleting, then adding more code, trying to PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE. I have completed two free online courses on JavaScript for Beginners, so now I am putting what I have picked up into fake almost bare websites hoping for some awesome action. 

This is part of me growing as a beginner web designer. Figuring out JS code on my own, which includes help from the community when needed. Thus I am here.
